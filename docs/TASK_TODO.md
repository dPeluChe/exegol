## Priority Order

### Wave 1 — Stack Optimizations (Terax Review, 2026-05) — ✅ SHIPPED
Strategic context: we stay on **Electron + spawned-CLI agents** (our core differentiator).
Terax (Tauri-based terminal) is more focused than us — adopted their tighter patterns inside our stack. Full analysis: `docs/RESEARCH/TERAX_STACK_REVIEW.md`.

**Shipped (see `docs/tasks_completed/2026_05.md` for details):**
- Quick wins (T108 build opts · T110 streamdown + diff cache · T111 tokenlens · T121 electron-window-state · T103 release config)
- WT1 — Terminal Foundations (T112 OSC 7+133 · T113 PTY flusher hardening · T115 DormantRing) + TerminalInstance split
- WT2 — Security Hardening (T117 path-guard + command-guard · T118 CSP tightening · T119 capability allowlist)
- WT3 — Rust Search Backend (T116 ignore + grep-* + globset + fsSearchRouter)
- WT4 — Parallel Multi-Agent + Agent UX (T65 completion/broadcast · T107 comparator · T105 isolation badge · T106 stop-reason panel) + manager.ts + TerminalPanel splits
- WT5 — Codebase Hygiene Splits (6 monolith files >500 LOC split, pure motion)

**Wave 1 deferred to wave 3 (decided post-merge):**
- **xterm renderer pool** (T114, L) — 5-slot LRU pool with snapshot+replay, blocks N-WebGL-context lag at high tab counts
- **Settings as separate window** (T120, M) — use floating BrowserWindow infra
- **Vercel AI SDK + Ollama** (T122, M, P3) — replace 2 fetch calls in `diff.ts` + `scoring.ts`, unlock Ollama via `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`

### Manual verification pending (post-merge)
Wave 1+2 landed via 5 parallel WTs. Manual smoke-test recommended before broad release:
- OSC 7 cwd badge on shell panes (open shell, `cd /tmp`, verify badge updates)
- OSC 133 prompt boundaries (jump-to-previous-prompt should work)
- Parallel agent comparator (spawn 2-3 agents on same task, verify columns + promote button)
- Isolation badge states (isolated / pipeline / project-root / fallback)
- Stop-reason panel (let an agent finish/fail, verify overlay with resume/new-task/diff actions)
- CSP changes (open DevTools console, verify zero CSP violations on basic flow)
- Capability allowlist (no functional regression — all routers/IPC still callable from renderer)

### P0 — Must land before broad release push
- _(empty — all P0 items shipped in wave 1+2)_

### P1 — Differentiators for first users
- **Ralph loops in pipelines** (T88) — evaluator step for iterative refinement

### P2 — Valuable follow-ups once the core is stable
- Issue tracker expansion (T71)

### P3 — Strategic bets / larger scope
- **SSH Remote Development** (T73)
- **CI/CD release pipeline** (T45) — activate when repo goes public
- **Canary channel** (T46)
- **Cross-repo workspaces** (T92) — front + back in one workspace
- **Mobile companion app** (T93) — monitor agents from phone via daemon
- **Headless daemon mode** (T94) — remote WebSocket for cloud/server deploys
- **Panel Plugin SDK** (T97) — extensible panel system, community plugins, v1.0 architecture

## Active Backlog

### T58 — Runtime Permission Modes
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: Medium | **Source**: Anvil

**Why**
- Creates clearer runtime control for risky or high-cost agent sessions.
- Useful foundation for scheduler, hooks, and later automations.

**Done (v0.4.3)**
- Types: `AgentAccessMode` (`read`, `write`, `plan`) + DB migration
- Spawn-time injection (prompt prefix + `EXEGOL_ACCESS_MODE` env var)
- SpawnAgentModal mode selector (Full Access / Plan Only / Read Only)
- Access mode badge in live terminal toolbar
- Pipeline step `accessMode` field + executor propagation + editor UI

**Remaining**
- Runtime mode switching (change mode while agent is running)
- Scheduler task `accessMode` propagation

**Likely files**
- `apps/desktop/src/main/agents/*`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/pipeline/*`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/agents/SpawnAgentModal.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/terminal/*`

---

### T60 — Project Hook Scripts (`exegol.yaml`)
**Priority**: P2 | **Effort**: Medium | **Source**: Orca + Emdash

**Why**
- Projects often need setup/teardown steps around worktree creation and archival.
- This becomes much more useful once worktrees are real.

**Scope**
- `exegol.yaml` in project root with `setup`, `archive`, `preAgent`, `postAgent` hooks
- 2-minute timeout and non-blocking execution
- Environment vars: `EXEGOL_ROOT_PATH`, `EXEGOL_WORKTREE_PATH`, `EXEGOL_BRANCH`, `EXEGOL_AGENT_ID`

**Depends on**
- T61 for worktree lifecycle integration

**Likely files**
- `apps/desktop/src/main/hooks/*`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/agents/*`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/db/*`

---

### T71 — Issue Tracker Expansion (Linear / Jira)
**Priority**: P2 | **Effort**: Medium | **Source**: Emdash

**Why**
- GitHub Issues is a good start, but adoption expands if task ingest is not GitHub-only.

**Scope**
- Add Linear and Jira task import/create flows
- Convert ticket into task/prompt/agent assignment
- Link review outcome or PR back to source ticket

**Likely files**
- `apps/desktop/src/main/ipc/procedures/github.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/ipc/*`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/workspace/sections/TasksSection.tsx`

---

### T73 — SSH Remote Development
**Priority**: P3 | **Effort**: High | **Source**: Emdash + Orca (stablyai/orca)

**Why**
- High upside, but too large to mix into the current release-critical wave.
- Orca already ships SSH with a clean provider dispatch pattern worth following.

**Scope**
- Remote project registration via SSH
- PTY over SSH with reconnect/persistence strategy
- Remote git/worktree operations
- Credentials in OS keychain

**Architecture reference — Orca's provider dispatch pattern**
Orca (stablyai/orca) implements SSH via parallel provider pairs in `src/main/providers/`:
```
local-pty-provider.ts    ←→  ssh-pty-provider.ts
(local git via runner.ts) ←→  ssh-git-provider.ts
(local fs)                ←→  ssh-filesystem-provider.ts
```
Each operation (spawn PTY, run git command, read/write files) has a local and SSH variant
behind a dispatch layer (`provider-dispatch.ts`). The dispatch routes based on project
location (local path vs ssh://host). Key files to study:
- `ssh-pty-provider.ts` — PTY sessions over SSH with shell-ready detection
- `ssh-git-provider.ts` — git commands tunneled through SSH
- `ssh-filesystem-dispatch.ts` — file read/write routing

**Recommended approach for Exegol:**
1. Create `apps/desktop/src/main/providers/` with `types.ts` defining `PtyProvider`, `GitProvider`, `FsProvider` interfaces
2. Extract current local implementations as `local-pty-provider.ts`, `local-git-provider.ts`
3. Add SSH variants that implement the same interfaces
4. Dispatch layer reads project config (`project.remote?: { host, user, path }`)
5. Agent spawn flow calls provider.createPty() instead of hardcoded local PTY

**Likely files**
- New: `apps/desktop/src/main/providers/*` (dispatch + local/SSH provider pairs)
- `apps/desktop/src/main/agents/manager.ts` (spawn via provider dispatch)
- `apps/desktop/src/main/terminal/pty-sidecar-client.ts` (local PTY → provider interface)
- `packages/core-rust/src/git/` (local git → provider interface)
- Project model and settings (remote SSH config)

## Codebase Quality & Health (from deep analysis)

> They address technical debt, testability, and robustness gaps that will compound if left unattended.

## Post-launch Backlog — Inspired by Competitors

### T88 — Ralph Loops in Pipelines
**Priority**: P2 | **Effort**: Medium | **Source**: Paseo orchestration skills

**Why**
- Current pipeline loop mechanism (`loopBackTo` + maxIterations) is static. Paseo's
  "Ralph" pattern runs a lightweight evaluator between steps that decides whether
  the previous step met the acceptance criteria. This turns pipelines from scripts
  into goal-seeking workflows.

**Scope**
- New step type: `evaluator` with fields `acceptanceCriteria` (prompt),
  `onPassNext` (step id), `onFailNext` (step id, usually a loop-back), `maxLoops`
- PipelineExecutor: when the evaluator step runs, it spawns a small agent with
  `{{previousOutput}}` + `{{diff}}` + criteria, parses response as `PASS` or
  `RETRY: <feedback>`, and routes accordingly
- Retry path injects the `<feedback>` into the next step's prompt as
  `{{retryFeedback}}`
- UI: distinct icon in PipelineEditor, visual loop arrow when editing
- Safety: hard max (e.g., 10 iterations) even if maxLoops is higher

**Likely files**
- `packages/shared/src/types/pipeline.ts` (new step type)
- `apps/desktop/src/main/pipeline/executor.ts` (evaluator routing)
- `apps/desktop/src/main/pipeline/context.ts` (retryFeedback variable)
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/workspace/sections/pipeline/PipelineEditor.tsx`

---

### T92 — Cross-repo Workspaces
**Priority**: P3 | **Effort**: Large | **Source**: Superconductor

**Why**
- Multi-repo projects (frontend + backend + infra) are extremely common. Users
  today open 3 Exegol windows or switch projects constantly. Sharing a workspace
  across repos with coordinated branches would be a significant differentiator.

**Scope**
- Allow a workspace tab to bind to N projects instead of 1
- Branch coordination: when creating a branch in repo A, offer to create the same
  named branch in repo B, C
- Shared agent context: an agent spawned in this workspace can have working paths
  in all bound repos
- Cross-repo diff view: single diff screen showing changes across repos
- Requires significant refactor of workspace store + ProjectContext

**Likely files**
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/stores/workspace.ts` (multi-project binding)
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/contexts/ProjectContext.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/agents/manager.ts` (multi-cwd agent)
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/workspace/GitPane.tsx` (cross-repo diff)

---

### T93 — Mobile Companion App
**Priority**: P3 | **Effort**: Very large | **Source**: Paseo Expo client

**Why**
- Long-running agents benefit enormously from remote monitoring: get notified on
  the phone when an agent enters `waiting_input`, approve/deny, read scrollback.
  This is Paseo's killer differentiator.
- Requires T94 (daemon mode) as prerequisite.

**Scope**
- New Expo/React Native app in `apps/mobile/`
- Connects to daemon via WebSocket + auth token (QR code pairing)
- v1: read-only — list agents, status, read ring buffer, push notifications
- v1.1: approve waiting_input, send one-line prompts, kill agents
- v2: full terminal view via a terminal emulator library

**Likely files**
- New: `apps/mobile/` (entire new Expo app)
- `apps/desktop/src/main/daemon/ws-server.ts` (WebSocket transport for mobile)
- `apps/desktop/src/main/security/pairing.ts` (QR token exchange)

---

### T94 — Headless Daemon Mode
**Priority**: P3 | **Effort**: Large | **Source**: Paseo daemon architecture

**Why**
- Prerequisite for T93 (mobile) and a valuable standalone feature: run Exegol
  on a server/VPS and connect from anywhere. Enables CI-style agent pipelines
  without keeping the desktop app open.

**Scope**
- Extract the sidecar + DB + agent manager into a standalone daemon that runs
  without Electron (pure Node)
- Expose the existing tRPC router over WebSocket in addition to IPC
- Auth: token-based, stored in OS keychain for desktop client, in user file for
  mobile/CLI
- Desktop app becomes "a thin client to the daemon" by default, can still run
  embedded daemon for local use
- CLI (T89) also benefits from remote connection mode

**Likely files**
- New: `apps/daemon/` (standalone daemon bundle)
- `apps/desktop/src/main/ipc/router.ts` (WebSocket transport)
- `apps/desktop/src/main/security/keystore.ts` (daemon tokens)
- `packages/shared/src/transport/*` (shared ws protocol)

---

### T97 — Panel Plugin SDK
**Priority**: P3 | **Effort**: Very large (2-4 weeks) | **Source**: kcosr/assistant

**Why**
- This is the single biggest architectural evolution Exegol could make for community
  growth. Today every workspace section (Tasks, Prompts, Memory, Pipelines,
  Resources, Scoring) is a hardcoded React component. Adding a new panel requires
  editing core code. kcosr/assistant proves the plugin model works: a manifest.json
  + server.js + bundle.js + auto-generated CLI — drop it in a directory and the app
  discovers it at runtime.
- Exegol becomes a **platform** instead of a **product**: community members build
  panels for Jira integration, Notion sync, custom dashboards, etc. without PRs.
- Pairs naturally with T89 (CLI): each plugin's operations become CLI commands
  automatically, just like kcosr/assistant's SKILL.md + bin/<plugin>-cli pattern.

**Scope (exploratory — needs a design spike first)**
- Define a `PluginManifest` JSON schema:
  - `id`, `name`, `version`, `description`
  - `panels`: list of `{ id, label, icon, bundlePath }`
  - `operations`: list of tool/HTTP/CLI operations the plugin exposes
  - `serverModule`: optional Node.js entry point for backend logic
  - `permissions`: what IPC/tRPC procedures the plugin can call
- Plugin discovery at startup: scan `~/.exegol/plugins/` + bundled official plugins
- **Backend host**: load server modules into sandboxed contexts in the main process,
  expose their operations as tRPC sub-routers
- **Frontend loader**: dynamic `<script>` loader + global panel registry API
  (similar to kcosr's `registerPanel()`)
- **Panel chrome**: iframe or React lazy + dynamic import per panel, with a host
  API object (state persistence, IPC to backend, session context)
- **Official plugins migration**: gradually extract Tasks, Prompts, Memory, etc. into
  `packages/plugins/official/` following the same contract, so they serve as
  reference implementations
- **CLI generation**: for each plugin operation, emit a CLI binding in `packages/cli/`
  (if T89 lands first) or a generated standalone script

**Design constraints**
- Security: plugins must not access the full main process — sandboxed IPC only
- Bundle impact: panel bundles loaded on demand (lazy), not in the initial chunk
- Backward compat: existing users who never install plugins see zero difference
- DX: `exegol plugin create <name>` scaffolds a hello-world plugin with manifest +
  server + panel

**Likely files (new)**
- New: `packages/plugin-sdk/` (manifest schema, host API types, panel protocol)
- New: `apps/desktop/src/main/plugins/host.ts` (discovery, loader, sandbox)
- New: `apps/desktop/src/main/plugins/registry.ts` (operation → tRPC bridge)
- New: `apps/desktop/src/renderer/lib/plugin-loader.ts` (dynamic panel loading)
- Modified: `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/workspace/WorkspaceView.tsx`
  (render plugin panels alongside built-in sections)

## Terax Review — Stack Optimizations (Wave 1)

> Source: `docs/RESEARCH/TERAX_STACK_REVIEW.md` (Terax-AI vs Exegol comparison, 2026-05-21).
> All tasks below cite specific Terax files when copying patterns.
> Strategic stance: keep AI-spawned CLI as our core; adopt Terax's tighter implementation patterns.

### T114 — xterm Renderer Pool
**Priority**: Wave 1 / P3 | **Effort**: L | **Source**: Terax `src/modules/terminal/lib/rendererPool.ts:1-700`

**Why**
- Today: 1 xterm instance per pane = 1 WebGL context per pane. 10+ tabs saturates GPU and balloons memory.
- Terax keeps ≤5 active slots in a pool; hidden tabs release their slot after snapshotting screen + push live ring into DormantRing (T115).
- When the tab returns: pick best slot (LRU, deprioritize alt-screen + focused), reset, write snapshot, replay ring. For alt-screen TUIs (vim, htop): discard ring, force SIGWINCH "kick".

**Scope**
- Lift `rendererPool.ts` into `apps/desktop/src/renderer/lib/terminal-pool.ts`.
- Replace `TerminalInstance` with `usePooledTerminal(paneId, container)` hook.
- Permanent off-screen recycler div (`position: fixed; left: -99999px; contain: strict`).
- Wire `WorkspacePane` so hidden panes release the slot instead of unmounting.
- Floating PiP (T84) integration: ensure snapshot/replay works when a pane detaches.
- WebGL context-loss recovery (already in T113, adapt for pool).

**Depends on**
- T115 (DormantRing) — ideally ship T115 first as standalone, then build pool on top.

**Risk**
- Our sidecar ring already provides instant reconnect; pool's value is only above ~5 concurrent tabs.
- Cross-cuts Workspace, FloatingPaneRoot, ring-buffer reattach, snapshot replay.

**Likely files**
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/lib/terminal-pool.ts` (new)
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/terminal/TerminalInstance.tsx` (replaced or wrapped)
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/workspace/WorkspacePane.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/FloatingPaneRoot.tsx`

---

### T120 — Settings as Separate BrowserWindow
**Priority**: Wave 1 / P2 | **Effort**: M | **Source**: Terax `src-tauri/src/lib.rs:32-86`

**Why**
- Today `SettingsPanel` is a modal in the main window — opening it covers the terminal layout.
- We already have `windows/floating.ts` (T84 PiP) — same primitive works for a settings window.
- Better multitask: keep an eye on agent output while changing API keys, themes, etc.

**Scope**
- New `apps/desktop/src/main/windows/settings.ts`:
  - `openSettingsWindow(tab?: string)`: open if not exists, focus if exists, emit deep-link event for specific tab.
  - `parent: mainWindow` (lifecycle tied — closes when main closes).
  - **Do NOT use `alwaysOnTop: true`** — anti-pattern (fights Mission Control on macOS, listed in review).
- Renderer: settings webview entry (`?settings=1`) mounts `<SettingsPanel/>` standalone.
- Replace current modal trigger with IPC call to `openSettingsWindow`.
- Deep-link example: "No API key" error → button "Open API Keys" → `openSettingsWindow('api-keys')`.

**Likely files**
- `apps/desktop/src/main/windows/settings.ts` (new)
- `apps/desktop/src/main/ipc/procedures/window.ts` (new IPC)
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/main.tsx` (route on `?settings=1`)
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/settings/SettingsPanel.tsx` (adapt to standalone)

---

### T122 — Vercel AI SDK + Ollama Support
**Priority**: Wave 1 / P3 (radar) | **Effort**: M | **Source**: Terax `src/modules/ai/lib/agent.ts:70-211` + `transport.ts:71-114`

**Why**
- Today our two direct LLM calls (`diff.ts:324-396` Smart Git Button commit msg + `scoring.ts:210-280` Tier-3 LLM-as-judge) use raw `fetch()` to `api.anthropic.com`. No cache breakpoints, no retry, no abort beyond timeout, brittle regex parse for structured output.
- Vercel AI SDK v6 gives us all of that + provider-agnostic API. Unlocks **Ollama / LM Studio / local models** via `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` with a single abstraction.
- Not vital for our spawned-CLI core — keep on radar but value compounds if we add more in-process LLM utilities.

**Scope**
- Add deps: `ai`, `@ai-sdk/anthropic`, `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` (for Ollama/LM Studio).
- New `apps/desktop/src/main/ai/llm.ts`:
  - `getAnthropic(db)`: pulls key from `keystore`, returns `LanguageModel`.
  - `getOllama(baseUrl)`: returns local OpenAI-compatible model.
  - `applyCacheBreakpoints(messages)`: helper porting Terax's `agent.ts:294-311` pattern.
- Refactor `diff.ts:324-396`:
  - `generateText({ model, prompt, maxOutputTokens: 120, abortSignal })` instead of fetch.
- Refactor `scoring.ts:210-280`:
  - `generateObject({ model, schema: z.object({ clarity: z.number().min(1).max(5), ... }) })` — replaces regex parse on `text.match(/\{[^}]+\}/)`.
  - Apply cache breakpoints for ~30–50 % cost reduction across Tier-3 evaluations.
- Settings UI: new "Local Models" section under API Keys for Ollama base URL + model picker.
- **Anti-pattern reminder**: do NOT add separate code branches for Ollama / LM Studio / MLX. Single OpenAI-compatible abstraction with base-URL + name + key + headers config.

**Likely files**
- `apps/desktop/package.json`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/ai/llm.ts` (new)
- `apps/desktop/src/main/ipc/procedures/diff.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/main/agents/scoring.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/settings/ApiKeysSettings.tsx` (Ollama config)
